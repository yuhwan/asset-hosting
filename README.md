# asset-hosting
This repository is designated to host asset files on github. Hosting assets on the github helps me to easily manage asset files. 

1. Github gives anurl address for an asset when I upload the file on the github.
2. I could easily search assets with name and tag.
3. I don't need to store asset files on my local machine, which occupies the disk space.
